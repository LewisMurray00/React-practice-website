## React-Router-Dom Guide

- {Link} renders an {a} with a real href
- {BrowserRouter} uses regular URL paths, so web server serves the same page at all URLs that are managed client side
- When a {Switch} (V5) or {Routes} (V6+) is rendered it searches through its children elements to find one which path matches the current URL
- {Route} are the children elements of the {Switch/Routes}

## Font-Awesome

- Used this as a way to get the icons for a hamburger bar
