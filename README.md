## React-Router-Dom Guide

- <Link> renders an <a> with a real href
- <BrowserRouter> uses regular URL paths, so web server serves the same page at all URLs that are managed client side
- When a <Switch> (V5) or <Routes> (V6+) is rendered it searches through its children elements to find one which path matches the current URL
- <Route> are the children elements of the <Switch/Routes>

## Font-Awesome

- Used this as a way to get the icons for a hamburger bar
